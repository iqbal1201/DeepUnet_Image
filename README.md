## DeepUnet - Image Semantic Segmentation
UNet is a popular deep learning architecture widely used for semantic segmentation tasks, including the analysis of satellite imagery. Its distinctive U-shaped architecture consists of a contracting path, which captures context and reduces spatial dimensions through convolutional and pooling layers, and an expansive path, which enables precise localization using transposed convolutions. This design allows UNet to effectively handle spatially varying structures in satellite images, making it suitable for applications such as land cover classification, urban development monitoring, and disaster damage assessment. With its ability to learn rich hierarchical features and accurately delineate objects of interest, UNet has become a cornerstone in the field of remote sensing and satellite image analysis.
